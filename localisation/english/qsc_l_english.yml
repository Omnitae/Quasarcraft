 ap_quasarcraft_research: "Galactic Warfare"
 ap_quasarcraft_research_desc: "Even with the great might of the §HQuasi-Stellar Obliterator§!, it has become glaringly clear there are horrors not only outclassing the capabilities of the weapon, but acting faster than it can calibrate its shots. \n\nThis therefore necessitates the construction of something even greater than the QSO AND the §HStellar Systemcraft§! combined. Thus is the dawn of a new era of warfare, and of galactic history. \n\n\tSuch is the dawn of an idea so mad within our engineer's minds, that even the ones who dreamed up the Systemcraft deemed it impossible... \n\n§RUntil now.§!"
